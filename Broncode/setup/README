How to deploy on Windows

First make sure that you have compiled the latest version.
1. Choose "Release mode".
2. Compile the source code.
3. The executable will show up in a directory like: workspace/build-qDAMEdit-Desktop_Qt_5_9_0_MSVC2013_64bit-Release/release/
4. Clear the deploy directory and copy the executable into it.

Now we need to find all the dependencies.

5. Open a command terminal in Windows.
6. Goto C:\Qt\5.9\bin
7. Run this command: windeployqt.exe full-path-to-deploy-directory
8. Now almost all the dependencies will be copied to the deploy directory.
9. Copy extra dependencies from the directory setup/extra to the deploy directory.

Finally it is time to create the installer.

10. Open Innosetup
11. Open setup/qdamedit.iss
12. Edit version number when needed
13. Compile and test
14. The setup will be created in setup/Output
